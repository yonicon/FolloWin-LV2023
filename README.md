# FolloWin-LV2023
 
 This is the public download directory of the FolloWin Demo project. 
 It demonstrates a GUI object that follows the mouse around and shows information. 
 
 In order to run this code you need LabVIEW 2023 or compatible. 

 To use just open the project file "FolloWin.lvproj" in LabVIEW enviroment then open and run the top level VI "FolloWinDemo.vi"
 
 I hope you will find this Demo and the object useful. 
 
Cheers, Yoni
